            <h1>The Comprehensive Student Learning Platform</h1>
            <p>
              MARGDARSHAK is not just a tool; it is a complete ecosystem designed to help students achieve academic excellence. 
              Founded by <strong>VSAV GYANTAPA</strong> in 2026, we address the core challenges of modern education: fragmentation, procrastination, and lack of organization.
            </p>
          </section>

          <article>
            <h2>Our Core Productivity Tools</h2>
            <p>We provide a suite of professional-grade tools, completely free for students.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Advanced Scientific Calculator</h3>
            <p>
              Forget carrying bulky physical calculators. Our online scientific calculator supports advanced mathematical functions required for High School and University curriculums.
              Features include trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic calculations (log, ln), factorials, and exponential powers. 
              It is optimized for mobile devices, allowing you to solve complex calculus problems on the go.
            </p>

            <h3>2. The Pomodoro Focus Timer</h3>
            <p>
              Based on the technique developed by Francesco Cirillo, our timer helps you break work into 25-minute intervals separated by short breaks.
              This method is scientifically proven to improve mental agility. Unlike standard phone timers, MARGDARSHAK's timer is integrated with your task list,
              allowing you to track exactly how many "Focus Cycles" you spend on each assignment.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Weighted Grade Tracker</h3>
            <p>
              Understanding your academic standing shouldn't be a mystery. Our Grade Tracker allows you to input grades with specific weights (e.g., "Final Exam is worth 40%").
              The algorithm instantly calculates your current GPA and, more importantly, forecasts what grades you need on future exams to maintain your desired average.

            <h2>Study Technique: The Power of Spaced Repetition</h2>
            <p>
              One of the most effective ways to learn is through <strong>Spaced Repetition</strong>. This evidence-based learning technique involves reviewing information at increasing intervals.
              Instead of cramming for five hours one night before an exam (which leads to the "Forgetting Curve"), you study for 30 minutes over ten days.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Why it works:</strong> When you review material just as you are about to forget it, your brain has to work harder to retrieve the memory. 
              This cognitive effort strengthens the neural pathways, moving information from short-term to long-term memory. 
              MARGDARSHAK's syllabus tracker is designed to help you schedule these review sessions effectively.
            </p>
            <h3>Applying Active Recall</h3>
            <p>
              Pair spaced repetition with <strong>Active Recall</strong>. Don't just re-read your notes (which is passive). Close your book and try to write down everything you remember.
              This forces your brain to generate the answer, which is far more effective for retention than recognition.
            </p>

            <h2>Managing Academic Stress & Burnout</h2>
            <p>
              Academic burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It occurs when you feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and unable to meet constant demands.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Prioritize Sleep:</strong> Your brain consolidates memories during REM sleep. Pulling all-nighters actually destroys the memories you formed during the day.</li>
              <li><strong>The 80/20 Rule:</strong> 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. Identify the high-value topics in your syllabus and focus on them first.</li>
              <li><strong>Digital Detox:</strong> Constant notifications fragment your attention span. Use our Focus Mode to silence distractions while you work.</li>
            </ul>
